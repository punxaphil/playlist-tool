* Methods should never be longer than 10 lines.
* Files should never be longer than 100 lines.
* Avoid duplicate code.
* Use early returns to reduce nesting.
* Use descriptive variable and function names.
* Prefer composition to inheritance.
* Write pure functions whenever possible.
* Avoid side effects in functions.
* Use constants for fixed values instead of magic numbers or strings.
* Never use `eslint-disable` or `/* eslint-disable */` comments to silence linter errors; instead fix the underlying issue
* Avoid redundant variables: don't create temporary variables that simply rename another value unless it improves readability or documents intent. Prefer direct returns, destructuring, and small helper functions. If a variable adds clarity, name it descriptively and keep its scope minimal.
* no unused variables, functions, imports, or exports
